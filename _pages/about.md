In a previous version, I had a long write-up here, talking about my inspiration to pursue engineering, my passions
throughout my school years â€” making the case for why I thought I was a big deal.

But one identity crisis and [a realization]({% post_url 2024-08-27-coming-out %}) later, suddenly it's not all that
important for me to say all of that. So instead, I'll add a few bullet points, and as I add more to this website, you
can fill in the rest:

- I'm Jessica Rodriguez. Hi!
- Currently, I work as a Software Engineer on Platform Integrations at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com). I did a
  16-month internship with the WildFly Elytron team.
- I studied Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
- During that time, I was a member of [UTAT Space Systems](https://www.utat.ca/space-systems), and spent a few years as
  the Firmware System Lead. I'm still an advisor to the team.
- I like skiing, kayaking, and cycling.
- There's still so much I haven't even tried yet. Figuring out where to start.
