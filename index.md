Hi, I'm Jessica!

This website is a bit barren, but I'm hoping to add more stuff to it soon. I'm also making it easier to manage than my last attempt...

You can find me at the links in the sidebar. If you need to secure a message or validate a commit, my (current) GPG fingerprint is `6D71 C504 6A9A 4B98 DAE9 5EE8 BBA3 C03E D204 C805`, for email address _dev at jessicarod period com_, available from [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/) and other keyservers.
