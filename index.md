Hi, I'm Jessica!

This is my personal website, where I blog about interesting stuff, weird feelings, and anything else
that comes to mind. There isn't really a theme or schedule to what I put up. If that somehow sounds appealing, you can
subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ "/feed.xml" | absolute_url }}).

You can find me at the links in the sidebar or behind the follow button. If you need to secure a message or validate a commit, my (current) GPG
fingerprint is `6D71 C504 6A9A 4B98 DAE9 5EE8 BBA3 C03E D204 C805`, for email address _dev at jessicarod period com_,
available from [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/) and other keyservers.
